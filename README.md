# kondo-bot
A Discord bot with a few niche functions.

It periodically renames the people who append special characters (!, .) to the start of their name to show up at the top of the userlist.
Users whose original names (i.e., not their server nicks) contain these characters will not be affected.

This bot also fetches JP Project Sekai event data from the sekai.best API. 
The name of the event can be manually changed if a translation is available, and its corresponding banner image and start and end times are also fetched.
